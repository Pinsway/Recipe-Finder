# Recipe-Finder
Group project made for mobile app development course.  
Our app is for finding recipes. The goal is for the app to display desired recipes based on preferences as an end goal. There will be several options to finding recipes. A general recipe finder where you can choose different preferences and get displayed recipes based on these preferences. Another option will be a recipe swiper, where you get displayed random recipes and swipe them left or right based on whether you like it or not.
